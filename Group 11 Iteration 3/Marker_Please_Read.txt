Some Notes Regarding Iteration 3

-The jar file only runs on Linux and you can run it on a linux machine 
 using this command
 "java -jar blokus.jar"
-The jar file would not work if you do not have any session saved
 It would stop working if you load it without the saved session.
-Please save a session first and then try the load use case.
-The load feature only has one save as of now but we're planning to use
 to add a gui to show all the sessions later on in the course.
-The included code in minor release can be run using this command.
 On Windows
 "javac -cp ".;json-simple-1.1.jar" *.java"
 "java -cp ".;json-simple-1.1.jar" GUI"
 On Linux
 "javac -cp ".:json-simple-1.1.jar" *.java"
 "java -cp ".:json-simple-1.1.jar" GUI"
-We are using json to save and load our board data since it's the most well
 know data structure to pass data.
-When the game starts, you will be presented with a black block which is the starting point
 (temporarily) to place a shape, this is because we were trying to figure out
 how the rules are going to work, but you can still place the shape like in an 
 actual game of blockus but only on the corners of the black shape.
-If you want to see our latest code at anytime feel free to have a look at
 our blokus folder in root directory of this repository.
