Some notes regarding Minor Release and code

-The jar file only runs on Linux and you can run it on a linux machine 
 using this command
 "java -jar blokus.jar"
-The jar file included has some couple GUI tweaks but the code for 
 functionality of the two use cases is still similar.
-When running the jar please make valid selections for players & computers
 otherwise the continue button would not work.
-We originally were supposed to implement load a game session in our 
 minor release but since to load a game we should first have save a 
 game session in place. Therefore, we decided to change our load a game
 session use case to rotation/flip of a shape.
-We have partially done placing a piece on the board but it still needs
 to have the rules implemented to behave like an actual blokus game which
 we plan to do that in the next iteration.
-The included code in minor release folder can be run via the following
 series of command
 "javac *.java"
 "java GUI"
-If you want to see our latest code at anytime feel free to have a look at
 our blokus folder in root directory of this repository.
